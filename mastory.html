  <h2 style="text-align: center;background-color:#18a1c4 ;"">The Silent Bell of Olorun</h2>

  <p>
    Long ago in the hills of Olorun, there stood a tall tower with a silver bell. The bell was said to ring only when the kingdom was in great danger. But for a hundred years, it remained silent, gathering dust and mystery.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a small cottage near the base of the tower lived a girl named Amira. She was a weaver’s daughter, full of questions and wonder. Though many feared the tower, Amira was drawn to it. Every evening, she’d watch the sun fall behind it and whisper, “What are you waiting for?”
  </p>

  <p>
    One night, the moon turned blood-red, and the earth trembled. Yet the bell did not ring. People panicked, thinking the old tales were lies. But Amira believed there was still magic in it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Against warnings, she climbed the tower. Each step echoed with stories of kings and queens, battles and peace. At the top, she found the bell chained, rusted—but still whole. She touched it gently and whispered, “Wake up.”
  </p>

  <p>

Suddenly, a soft chime rang out. Not loud, but deep and full of power. The sky cleared. The people looked up. The bell had spoken—not to warn, but to answer Amira’s call.
  </p>

  <p>
    From that day, Amira became the Keeper of the Bell. She did not rule the kingdom with power, but with wisdom and voice. The bell never rang in fear again, but in celebration of truth and courage.
